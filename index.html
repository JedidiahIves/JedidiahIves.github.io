      <h2><em>Me:</em></h2>
      <p>Howdy! I’m Jedidiah. I live in the wonderfully windiest of cities Chicago IL. I love burritos, improv, climbing, sci fi, and the way the wind caresses me in the winter.</p>

      <h2><em>Art:</em></h2>
      <p>&emsp;I’m a 3d artist, primarily using the tools known colloquially as Blender and Unreal Engine <em>(and the many others that are required to make 3d art really go bing bang).</em></p>
      <p>&emsp;I’m naturally drawn to science fiction when let on my lonesome, there is something about a future with lasers that just gets me goin’. You can see that in my art on my portfolio. <em>(unless I’ve changed it and forgot to update this website. Reach out and I can show you the dozens of space ships, laser guns, and lightsabers I’ve made)</em></p>
      <p>&emsp;Many of my first projects as a 3d artist were dioramas. I am immediately drawn to using sets and dressing to tell stories. Who was here, what happened here, why here?</p>
      <p>&emsp;I started diving deep into the 3d art world in the middle of a global pandemic, and haven't really looked back. I am primarily self taught, though I do have a strong foundation in general CAD work from my work in high school. I also have a strong technical background through my work as an AV programmer in Nashville TN.</p>
      <p>&emsp;I’ve also completed Thiago Klafke’s Environment Art Mastery course. Through it I learned a whole bunch about modularity, trim sheets, set dressing, and much much more. I really recommend you buy and take it.</p>
